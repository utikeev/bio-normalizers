# Sieve-based Disorder Normalizer

This approach uses a bunch of heuristic each represented as a *sieve* of a certain type.  
Compound phrase sieve and abbreviations extraction are omitted to enforce using of AB3P and SimConcept instead.

## Data

Terminology for the normalizer is built on top of the [MeSH® database](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/download/mesh.html).
