# Sieve-based Normalizer

This approach uses a bunch of heuristic each represented as a *sieve* of a certain type.  
Compound phrase sieve and abbreviations extraction are omitted to enforce using of AB3P and SimConcept instead.

Fun fact is, that this approach seemed to show itself as pretty entity-agnostic, so I decided to put it as a common
tool, which can be customized with the needed terminology and sieve config files.
